## Introduction

The name of this blog post is â€œCracking the Code," which is a pun on the fact that our article will revolve around the future of technology- AI and how anthropology will play a huge role in the future of AI development.

Being students in the fields of psychology and computer science, we, the authors, felt a personal connection to this topic. Human-Computer Interaction will be the key in the next phase of the 2020s and even further decades to come. The future is here, and we have the power of AI now. 

However, as the past has shown us, with the great power of AI comes the great responsibility of handling its potential pitfalls and biases.

Since our blog  project is part of a class that fulfills such a requirement, we want to trace the past, present and future of AI  to better understand how Anthropology will play a crucial role in AI ethics and maintaining accountability for automated machines and their respective stakeholders in the future.

Of course it is one species, who else could it be. The creator, the designer, the inventor of all things artificial,

humans.
