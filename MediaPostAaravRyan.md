## Introduction

The name of this blog post is â€œCracking the Code," which is a pun on the fact that our article will revolve around the future of technology- AI and how anthropology will play a huge role in the future of AI development.

Being students in the fields of psychology and computer science, we, the authors, felt a personal connection to this topic. Human-Computer Interaction will be the key in the next phase of the 2020s and even further decades to come. The future is here, and we have the power of AI now. 

However, as the past has shown us, with the great power of AI comes the great responsibility of handling its potential pitfalls and biases.

Since our blog project is part of a class that fulfills such a requirement, we want to trace the past, present and future of AI to better understand how Anthropology will play a crucial role in AI ethics and maintaining accountability for automated machines and their respective stakeholders in the future.

Let us understand AI as a human computer interaction, and how anthropology can help mediate this human-computer interaction. 


## The computational side: Make way for the Prince A-I!

In November 2022, potentially the biggest development in human history took place, with the release of the GPT-3 chat bot, better known as ChatGPT.

With over a 100 million users (https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/)
and its ever growing prevalence in academia and daily life, we know it is one of the instances to indicate that AI is here to stay. With this in mind, we must reflect on what AI really means.

Artificial intelligence is basically the simulation of sentient tasks using computational algorithms, trained on certain datasets, much like human beings. Put in a more humorous manner, "Artificial Intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things which, at the moment, people do better." (Rich and Knight, Artificial Intelligence, 1991)

So, why do we say that people do what AI accomplishes better, despite AI models being run on supercomputers much more powerful than human brains?

## The human side: Who's behind this all?

Of course it is one species, who else could it be. The creator, the designer, the inventor of all things artificial,

humans.

Whatever humans falter in, is compounded and reflected by their creations. Let us understand the mechanisms behind why we are going wrong in the human side of this Human-Computer Interaction.
