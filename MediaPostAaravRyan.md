## Introduction

The name of this blog post is â€œCracking the Code," which is a pun on the fact that our article will revolve around the future of technology- AI and how anthropology will play a huge role in the future of AI development.

Being students in the fields of psychology and computer science, we, the authors, felt a personal connection to this topic. Human-Computer Interaction will be the key in the next phase of the 2020s and even further decades to come. The future is here, and we have the power of AI now. 

However, as the past has shown us, with the great power of AI comes the great responsibility of handling its potential pitfalls and biases.

Since our blog project is part of a class that fulfills such a requirement, we want to trace the past, present and future of AI to better understand how Anthropology will play a crucial role in AI ethics and maintaining accountability for automated machines and their respective stakeholders in the future.

Let us understand AI as a human computer interaction, and how anthropology can help mediate this human-computer interaction. 


## The computational side: Make way for the Prince A-I!

In November 2022, potentially the biggest development in human history took place, with the release of the GPT-3 chat bot, better known as ChatGPT.

With over a 100 million users (https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/)
and its ever growing prevalence in academia and daily life, we know it is one of the instances to indicate that AI is here to stay. With this in mind, we must reflect on what AI really means.

Artificial intelligence is basically the simulation of sentient tasks using computational algorithms, trained on certain datasets, much like human beings. Put in a more humorous manner, "Artificial Intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things which, at the moment, people do better." (Rich and Knight, Artificial Intelligence, 1991)

So, why do we say that people do what AI accomplishes better, despite AI models being run on supercomputers much more powerful than human brains?


## The reason: Who's behind this all?

Of course it is one species, who else could it be. The creator, the designer, the inventor of all things artificial,

humans.

Whatever humans falter in, is compounded and reflected by their creations.

## How Anthropology helps
![Image](https://i.imgflip.com/7dtbbm.jpg)

Anthropology identifies the potential pitfalls and biases of the human side and mediates them, thereby minimising but not removing the biases that occur on the human side. 

### Relational Biases-
In human relationships, prejudices can result in unjust treatment and incorrect conclusions. These prejudices might be intentional or unintentional, and they frequently depend on characteristics like gender, color, age, and appearance. They can take many forms, including discrimination, prejudice, and stereotyping. Unwelcome biases can result in missed opportunities, a lack of diversity, and poor performance, among other undesirable results (Summarised from Week 1, lectures 1 and 2, and [Week 10](https://padlet.com/akennemore/anth-21-module-5-resource-board-intergroup-trust-belonging-sz1f729ofg71rb6k/wish/2394763844). Distrust between groups and lack of intersectionality also plays a part in this. 

In order to overcome these biases, it is critical to be aware of them, actively attempt to lessen their impact, and pursue objectivity and justice in the decision-making process.

Discrimination is faced because of the projection of the majority opinion on minorities, majorities occupying positions of power, minorities unable to fight back and succumbing to their opinion because they do not have any support or knowledge to fight the discrimination. 

Anthropology brings non-intersecting groups together under a common umbrella, divided by the majority and united by their experiences. Through the sharing of perspectives and an anthropological breakdown of the discrimination faced, minorities as well as majorities can be well equipped to identify and tackle these issues. The ProPublica study on the COMPAS dataset is a prime example. It was a jolt and a shockwave across the tech industry, bringing a furore within tech minorities and keeping a check on majorities to act accountably. This interpersonal accountability is brought about by Anthropology, along with the unison of minority groups to fight against hatred as one. 

### Hiring Biases-

(https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail)

Hiring biases are unintentional or intentional prejudices that have an impact on the recruiting decision-making process and cause candidates to be chosen based on criteria unrelated to their work performance or credentials. These prejudices can show themselves in different ways, depending on factors including gender, race, ethnicity, age, physical appearance, and educational background. Hiring biases can significantly affect the workplace's diversity and inclusivity as well as the business's overall success. To overcome recruiting biases, firms can employ measures such as blind resume screening, diversity training, and developing diverse hiring committees. 

To expand on the above, DEI training could be considered a solution, however, in practice, they are deemed ineffective. An anthropological overview shows that with interpersonal relationships, we do know the answers to the questions, but seem to be in a tutorial hell when it comes to implementing these solutions in real life. Companies use very negative sentiments with negative repercussions at present to curb relational biases. This creates a negative feedback loop which in turn causes employees to react negatively to the corporate structure, as DEI training is used as a punishment of sorts, creating a stigma against the whole concept. Encouraging the importance of the Business-Psychological factor of DEI, which deals with sentiments of classically discriminated groups and factors them into companies and algorithmic decision making is key to solving this problem. Anthropology puts forward these perspectives and sentiments of minority groups through its stories, and interestingly appreciates differences betweeen the general opinion and the minority opinion. The stigma against DEI can be removed through this positive reinforcement of creating better products and services for customers this way, while having thorough respect and attention to the minority stories and narratives. 

Another very human sentiment is vanity. If not ethics, human beings always succumb to the pressure of validation and vanity. The fear of not being socially acceptable and being shunned is a constant one. This human sentiment is driven to do positive things through anthropology. Anhtropological concepts and methodologies such as diversity camps, increased recruitment from minorities, exposure to minority surroundings, etc. have shown to drive up the reprsentation of minorities and a positive feeling around them. This means more minorities in the workplace and more people to interact with. People are motivated to be acceptible, which makes them accountable. It is this accountability which we need in the 21st century workplace, which is not possible without an anthropological intervention.
